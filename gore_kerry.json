Let there be no doubt, while I strongly disagree with the court's decision, I accept it. I accept the finality of this outcome which will be ratified next Monday in the Electoral College. And tonight, for the sake of our unity as a people and the strength of our democracy, I offer my concession.

The thing that really brings this theory down though is just looking at facts. The South, particularly Tennessee, shifted dramatically R from 1992-1996, and without the boost of incumbency, Gore was always at a disadvantage there. In fact, Tennessee had two Republican Senators and a Republican governor who had all been elected in landslides, and was less than 2.5% blue in 1996 (where it was 4.5% blue in 92). Even if somehow Clinton was running for a third term and he was under ‘96 like favorable conditions, trends would be so hard against him it would’ve been almost impossible to carry.</p><p>Here’s the meat of the argument: Al Gore had been Vice President under Bill Clinton, and Bill Clinton’s main campaigners, for the past 8 years. How much closer could he physically tie himself to Clinton? When you start an election campaign 6 points down as the incumbent R party under favorable circumstances, you need to shake things up. Coming from one of the most dismal campaign starts in modern Democratic History (only McGovern’s seems worse), Gore having a massive convention boost (after distancing himself from Clinton), and ONLY LEADING when he distanced himself from Clinton, it seemed like a solid strategy.</p><p>There is a point to be made about Tennessee, I mean Gore and his dad were Senators there and Gore was two term even before becoming VP. Note however, that Tennessee was far bluer than Kentucky, West Virginia, Arkansas, or Louisiana (all Clinton two time states). Taken in consideration with the fact that probably even Clinton wouldn’t have won Tennessee if he could’ve run in 2000, it seems far more reasonable. Gore wasn’t Clinton. Arkansas was 14 points R in 1988, and given how much the south shifted R during the following 12 years, Gore having it only be 5.4 points is solid as fuck. Arkansas SHIFTED R IN 1996, DESPITE THE NATIONWIDE BLUE SHIFT! The same is true of Missouri and Kentucky (two states Clinton won twice). Again, remember all this is true despite Clinton being the incumbent, being a more traditional southern Democrat than Al Gore, and winning massively in 1996. The point is, the “campaign with Clinton carry Arkansas” argument is false and frankly was never going to be true. It stems from the idea that the final election was close, but that Gore was favored. The main fiction about the 2000 election is that Gore was favored. I often quote the “17 points down” statistic, but Gore only led once (in national averaged Gallup polls), by a single point; throughout the whole campaign.</p></div>`;

   return `<div style="max-height: 270px; overflow-y: auto;"> <h3>Gore being down two points in polling before Election Day and still winning the PV by .5% is proof that Gore strongly outperformed expectations. Let alone the fact that even before Election Day people were calling the 2000 election the “closest election in American History”, before the Florida debacle could even happen.</h3><p>Now we move to Ralph Nader. Ralph Nader, the Green Party splinter that single handidly caused the war in Iraq. Look, Gore over performed expectations by 3%, and Nader underperformed expectations by about 1.5%. Gore’s campaign of Nader ignorance(while definitely seeming dumb the whole campaign) actually ended up working surprisingly well, meaning that no “liberal democratic states” fell into the Republican column, despite states like Oregon being surprisingly close. However, you could still say to all this: “ok, Gore was bad and worse than Clinton. How does that disprove anything?”. Look, Gore was the best candidate the Democrats had, having been on the national stage for 13 years, being a two term Senator, a Vietnam Vet, an Atari dem who was actually pretty young, and a proponent of the internet in the second election ever to include it. Further a second explanation for the R shift of the south is that, unlike most Republicans(McCain, Dole, H.W), Bush made conservatism(the south’s bread and butter) his BRAND. His damn slogan was “compassionate conservatism”, and save Gore advocating for overturning Roe, that wasn’t being beat. If you google “bill bradley Vs George bush polling”, you’ll get a few 1999 polls in random states that say Bradley was beating Gore. Just note, these were taken loooong before any primary started, and here’s some evidence to counteract it. Firstly, by October 1999(as shown by the comments above about Gore’s campaign coming back from the dead), Gore and Bush WERE TIED IN CALIFORNIA, with Gore supposedly being down 15-20 points. With this ABYSMAL polling, Bradley must have been coasting to beat those numbers, right? RIGHT? Gore was losing by 1 point in California, well within the margin of error(47-46). Bradley? He was losing 46-45. ANY DEMOCRAT WAS UNFAVORED IN 2000, GORE WINNING WOULD HAVE BEEN A TRUMAN LEVEL COMEBACK! The final point(and most important, though nobody will ever read it), is that Gore wasn’t perfect. From August to October, Bush and Gore were locked in a dead heat, statistical tie. Then, the debates. The 2000 Debates matter a lot as a matter of presidential politics, because it was the moment Bush regained momentum, and given how close the election ended up being, likely swayed the election.The point everyone likes to make is “Gore was a veteran debater, and he underperformed.” In many ways, this is fair. Gore’s half “No aggression” and then “be super assertive” strategy failed on stage and made him look weird. In some pretty pivotal ways, though, Gore didn’t do that awful. Bush’s strategy from the start was to downplay expectations, make Bush being able to breathe on stage seem like a major victory. Gore being a veteran debater was very much weaponized against him, because if he had been an upstart or not the incumbent, his performance wouldn’t be judged by the same lens. Something to be considered though, is that experts and even Americans at large, considered Gore the winner. It was divisive and nothing was a universally acclaimed win, but the debates “ended” in a Gore “victory.” However, if Gore hadn’t lockboxed so much or had kept a consistent strategy, he’d likely have been a much more acclaimed winner and could have even won the election. Gore did make some more substantial mistakes though. Joe Lieberman selection as Vice President, while maybe good for Jewish turnout, didn’t really make the ticket the “avowed moderate” it turned out to be, likely drove some support to Nader, and didn’t even beat Cheney in the VP Debate. Bob Graham, by a country fucking mile, would have been better. Now for the piece de resistance, Floridas results. Lets acknowledge for a second, that Clinton, in his rather large 1992 victory, didn’t carry Florida. Even in 96, he didn’t carry it by nearly as large a margin as he carried states like West Virginia. Florida shifting dramatically blue was a victory for Gore, a large, traditionally Republican state that was shifting away from their control. I won’t go into detail on the recount, won’t mention the butterfly ballots, won’t talk about Nader as a spoiler, but all this just to say that Gore was, for lack of a better word, fucking robbed. Bush vs Gore is it’s own beast, and we can’t pretend that it doesn’t deserve its own massive ass copypasta to be. Gore should have been declared the winner in Florida and I’ll be happy to individually talk to anyone who wants to about it.</p></div>`
